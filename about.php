      <h1>What SelfBased Means</h1>
      <p>Our definition of SelfBased is basically "based on yourself". By that, we mean, you have the power and control over yourself. We chose SelfBased as our logo and name because we believe that everybody should have control over what they want to learn and they should get the best sources. They should not be limited by schools or institutes. We also wanted to help the ones that want to learn things they want but cannot afford the money by organizing our sources so that it is affordable for everybody.</p>

        <h1>What We Believe</h1>
        <p>We believe that you should never limit yourself. We believe that each individual has the ability to learn or achieve any set of skills they desire. We believe that no individual should limit itself to what he/she knows right now, but to think of what one can achieve and do in the long run. We have made this site in order to help you become your true self, to find yourself, experiment with your abilities and to see what you can achieve.</p>

        <p>Our vision is clear. To help people to find themselves in their abilities, hobbies and interests. We want this website to stop people from settling with what they know or have now and to push themselves into their greater selves. We want to enlighten people, to inspire and to help people. Our vision is for everyone to <strong><em>Learn Something New.</em></strong></p>

        <h1>Our Moto</h1>
        <p>Our moto is clear, simple and self-explanatory. Its use is to help people and to push them into learning something new. It is to help them to step out of their comfort zone and to explore their abilities. It's to encourage them to find their inner selves and amaze themselves of what they can achieve. Most of us have talents that we have not discovered yet, and some never do, and we're here to change that.</p>

        <p class="center-text">Yep, that's right. Currently, SelfBased is run only by a "16-year-old teenager" and that is, of course, me, the one that's written every single code for the site. I'm currently working all by myself, but I'm hoping of building an amazing team that the users of this site deserve. If you are interested in joining the SelfBased team, please <a href="contact.php">Contact Us</a>!</p>
